# CNRS

Salaries of CNRS postdocs are fixed by the [Bulletin Officiel du CNRS](https://www.cnrs.fr/fr/bulletin-officiel), which consists in a massive (typically hundreds of pages) monthly issue collecting all the documents produced by the administration during the previous month.
There are several reasons why this document is not easy to navigate:
- it is in French, and it is not easy to find the relevant information if you do not know the language;
- even if you do know the language, the document is not structured in a way that makes it easy to find the tables;
- salary tables are updated in the document every few months in an erratic way, and it is not easy to find the most recent one.

The following documents are excerpts from the Bulletin Officiel.

The status of the CNRS personnel is regulated by the [Circulaire n° CIR130864DRH](/assets/excerpts/CNRS_2022_04_CIR130864DRH.pdf), originally issued on 12 March 2013 and, since then, updated many times.
This document implements in practice, at the CNRS level, the French [law n° 2020-1674](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loi_de_programmation_de_la_recherche_pour_les_ann%C3%A9es_2021_%C3%A0_2030) on public research.

One of the annexes of this bulletin is the barème de rémunération (salary table) of the CNRS contract personnel.
This table and its updated versions are the sources of the [CNRS salary tables](/pages/salariesCNRS) reported here.
The updates, decided by the CNRS HR management, are listed below by implementation date:

# CNES

Our source of the [CNES salary tables](/pages/salariesCNES) are original pay slips from past and current CNES postdocs,
shared with their consent. They are not public documents, and we cannot share them as-is, but redacted information can
be provided upon request. For further information, please contact [iva.laginja@obspm.fr](mailto:iva.laginja@obspm.fr).

CNES does not publish its postdoc salaries online, nor do they advertise them in their yearly call for applications
(as of their call for proposals 2024). When reaching out to them directly in the first half of 2024 with an inquiry
about gross postdoc salaries, our request remained without a response.

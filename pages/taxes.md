@def title = "Taxes in France"

The salaries we report in this website are _brut_ figures, that is before taxes. 
The salary of a postdoc is subject to taxes, which are automatically deducted from the salary by the host institution.
As far as we know, the taxes are the following:
- about 15% of the salary is deducted for social security;
- a variable value of the salary is deducted for income tax, according to the table described [here](https://www.economie.gouv.fr/particuliers/tranches-imposition-impot-revenu) (in French).

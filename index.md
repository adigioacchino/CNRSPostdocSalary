@def title = "CNRS postdoc salary reference"

# Why this website?

Salaries of CNRS postdocs are public, but it is not easy to find information about them. 
We had direct experience of starting postdocs in France without knowing what we were going to earn, since in most cases the salary is not specified in the offer letter and it is difficult to find information about it online or by asking administrative personnel, especially for non-French speakers.
We hope that this website will help future CNRS postdocs to have a reference about their salary.

# Sources
Salaries of CNRS postdocs are fixed by the [Bulletin Officiel du CNRS](https://www.cnrs.fr/fr/bulletin-officiel), which consists in massive (typically hundreds of pages) monthly issue collecting all the documents produced by the administration during the previous month.
There are several reasons why this document is not easy to navigate:
- it is in French, and it is not easy to find the relevant information if you don't know the language;
- it is not easy to find the relevant information even if you know the language, since the document is not structured in a way that makes it easy to find the salary tables;
- salary tables are updated in the document every few months in an erratic way, and it is not easy to find the most recent one.

# How to use this website
The website is structured in three sections:
- the ["Salary tables"](./salaries) section, where you can find our most updated knowledge about salary tables;
- the ["How to contribute"](./contribute) section, where you can find information about how to contribute to the website by adding new (or old) salary tables;
- the ["Contacts"](./contacts) section, where you can find our contact information.

You can navigate the website using the menu on the left.

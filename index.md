@def title = "French postdocs salary reference"

# Why this website?

Salaries of postdocs in France are often public knowledge, but it is not always easy to find information about them.
We had direct experience of starting a postdoc in France without knowing what we were going to earn, since in most cases the salary is not specified in the offer letter and it is difficult to find exact figures online or by asking administrative personnel, especially for non-French speakers.
We hope that this website will help future postdocs in France to have a reference about their salary.
